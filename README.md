## Overview of Project
### Steve's Stock Analysis
##### The purpose of this project is to analyze Steve's provided stock dataset. His intent for this project was to go deeper into the data to present to his parents. This analysis will provide what the outcome of the dataset is in summary and provide insight on how much time Steve can save now that we have automated some of the processes through VBA scripting and macro creations.

## Results
##### Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
