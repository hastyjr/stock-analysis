This analysis will provide what the outcome of the dataset is in summary and provide insight on how much time Steve can save now that we have automated some of the processes through VBA scripting and macro creations._

###  Optimizing Code with Refactoring
_As the orignal script was written you will see how the code was written in a way that can fetch the data in a timely manner, but not ncessarily efficient as possible as we compare both years.

When attempting to optimize the code to run more efficiently by refactoring, we implmented several steps to get there._

1. Created a `tickerIndex` with three output arrays: 
    * `tickerVolumes`, 
    * `tickerStartingPrices`, and 
    * `tickerEndingPrices`
2. Created a `for` loop
    * initialized the `tickerVolumes` to
